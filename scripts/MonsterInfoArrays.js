    description: `An ultra-aggressive creature that is rarely sighted
    and seldom survived. Those that have survived
    report that it exhibits a strange attack. Rajang
    are said to be loners, and this isolated life has
    made it difficult to pin down its territorial leanings.
    When angered, part of its pelt turns a golden color.
    
    A Rajang is most dangerous when its arms are
powered up, allowing it to even destroy Shock
Traps. Attack its tail to remove this effect. In
its regular state, it will also avoid Pitfall Traps.
It will immediately attack anything that invades
its territory, so watch your step.`,

    explosive scales over a wide area to prey
    on whatever gets caught in the blast.
    In some places, this has earned it
    the nickname "Bomber Wyvern."
    
    The formidable scales that the Bazelgeuse scatters
explode after receiving an impact but the time they
take to regenerate can be used as a chance to attack.
When its scales turn red hot, they will explode immediately
and require caution, however, parts of the
body will be soft tooâ€”the perfect time to attack.`,
